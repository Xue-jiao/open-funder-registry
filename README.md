# Crossref Funder Registry

The Funder Registry provides a common taxonomy of international funding body names that funding data participants should use to normalize funder names and IDs for deposit with Crossref.

The list should be used to present authors with a pre-populated "Funder Name" option at the time of submission, and can also be used to match funder names extracted from papers.

The list is available to download as an RDF file, and is freely available under a CC0 license waiver.
